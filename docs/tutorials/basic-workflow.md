3. **Locate the upload button** (usually labeled "Upload Files" or "Add Transcript")

### Upload Process
1. **Click the upload button**
2. **Select your sample file** using the file browser
3. **Add basic information:**
   - **Title**: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Team Planning Meeting - Jan 15")
   - **Description**: Brief summary of content (optional but recommended)
4. **Review settings:**
   - Keep default processing settings for now
   - Note any special options available
5. **Start the upload** by clicking "Upload" or "Start Processing"

### Monitor Progress
- **Watch the progress indicator** during file upload

- **Estimated time**: Expect 1-3 minutes per minute of audio
- **Background processing**: You can navigate away while it processes

**âœ… Checkpoint:** Your file is uploaded and processing has begun. You can see progress indicators.

## Step 3: Review Initial Results

### Wait for Completion
- **Processing notification**: Wait for completion notification or check status
- **Processing time**: Varies based on file length and system capabilities
- **Status indicators**: Look for "Complete" or green checkmarks

### Examine the Transcript
Once processing is complete:

1. **Open the transcript** by clicking on it in your Library
2. **Review the main content area:**
   - **Transcript text**: The speech converted to text
   - **Speaker labels**: May show "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", etc.
   - **Formatting**: Paragraph breaks and structure
3. **Check the metadata panel:**
   - **File information**: Original filename, duration, format
   - **Processing details**: Service used, processing time
   - **Quality indicators**: Confidence scores if available

### Initial Quality Assessment
**Look for these common patterns:**
- **Good transcription**: Most words are correct, clear structure
- **Speaker changes**: Notice where different people speak
- **Technical terms**: May need correction if domain-specific

**âœ… Checkpoint:** You can view your transcript and understand its basic structure and quality.

## Step 4: Improve the Transcript

### Edit for Accuracy
1. **Click the "Edit" button** in the transcript view
2. **Scan through the text** looking for obvious errors:
   - **Misspelled words**: Common transcription mistakes
   - **Technical terms**: Domain-specific vocabulary
   - **Proper nouns**: Names of people, places, companies
   - **Homophones**: Words that sound similar but are spelled differently

### Speaker Correction
If your audio has multiple speakers:
