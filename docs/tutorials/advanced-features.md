- Significantly better accuracy than basic transcription
- Support for multiple languages and specialized models
- Local installation for privacy and control

**Installation Options:**

**Option A: Local Installation (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Speaches locally (example commands)
pip install speaches
speaches serve --port 8000
```

**Option B: Docker Installation**
```bash
# Run Speaches in Docker container
docker run -p 8000:8000 speaches/server
```

**Option C: Remote Service**
- Use an existing Speaches instance on your network
- Configure URL to point to remote service

**Configure in DeepTalk:**
1. **Open Settings** → Transcription tab
2. **Set Service URL**: `http://localhost:8000` (or your Speaches instance)
3. **Test connection**: Click "Test" button to verify connectivity
4. **Select model**: Choose appropriate model for your content
   - **Small models**: Fast, good for clear audio
   - **Medium models**: Balanced speed/accuracy (recommended)
   - **Large models**: Best accuracy, slower processing

**Model Selection Guidelines:**
```
Content Type           Recommended Model
─────────────────      ─────────────────
Clear meetings         faster-distil-whisper-medium.en
Technical discussions  whisper-large-v2
Multiple languages     whisper-large-multilingual
Noisy environments     whisper-large-v2
Real-time processing   faster-distil-whisper-small.en
```

**✅ Checkpoint:** Speaches is installed, configured, and successfully tested in DeepTalk.

### Step 2: Set Up Ollama for AI Analysis

**What is Ollama?**
- Local AI service for running large language models

# Windows: Download from ollama.ai
```

**2. Download Models:**
```bash
# Start with a capable general model
ollama pull llama2

# For better performance, consider:
ollama pull mistral
ollama pull codellama  # For technical content
ollama pull llama2:13b # Larger model for better analysis
```

**3. Start Ollama Service:**
```bash
ollama serve
# Service runs on http://localhost:11434 by default
```

**Configure in DeepTalk:**

General analysis     llama2               Good balance of speed/quality
Technical content    codellama            Better at technical terminology
Detailed analysis    llama2:13b           More thorough insights
Creative tasks       mistral              Better at creative interpretation
Multi-language       llama2               Good multilingual support
```

**✅ Checkpoint:** Ollama is running with appropriate models and successfully integrated with DeepTalk.

## Part 2: Master AI Chat Conversations

### Step 3: Interactive Content Exploration

**Understanding Chat Modes:**

**Vector Search Mode:**
- Returns exact excerpts with relevance scores
- Best for fact-finding and quote discovery
- Fastest response time
- No AI interpretation

**RAG Mode (Recommended):**
- Retrieves relevant content and sends to AI for interpretation
- Natural, conversational responses
- Good balance of speed and comprehensiveness
- Context-aware answers

**Direct LLM Mode:**
- Sends full transcript to AI for comprehensive analysis
- Most thorough understanding and context
- Slower but most complete responses
- Best for complex analysis

### Advanced Chat Techniques

**Progressive Questioning Strategy:**
```
1. Start broad: "What were the main topics in this meeting?"
2. Focus: "Tell me more about the budget discussion"
3. Drill down: "What specific concerns were raised about the Q2 budget?"
4. Cross-reference: "How does this compare to previous budget discussions?"
5. Synthesize: "What patterns do you see in our budget planning process?"
```

**Multi-Turn Analysis:**
```
You: "Analyze the decision-making process in this transcript"
AI: [Provides initial analysis]
You: "What evidence supports the claim that Sarah was the primary decision-maker?"
AI: [Provides specific evidence and quotes]
You: "How could this decision-making process be improved?"
AI: [Provides recommendations based on analysis]
```

**Cross-Project Exploration:**
1. **Start chat in project context** to access multiple transcripts
2. **Ask comparative questions**: "How did the team's concerns change between the March and April meetings?"
3. **Track evolution**: "Show me how the timeline discussion evolved across these meetings"
4. **Identify patterns**: "What themes appear in all of our project meetings?"

### Chat Optimization Techniques

**Context Configuration:**
- **Chunk count**: Start with 4-6 relevant chunks, adjust based on response quality
- **Chunk size**: Use default settings initially, reduce if responses are too generic
- **Relevance threshold**: Increase if getting too much irrelevant content

**Query Optimization:**
- **Be specific**: "What did John say about the budget between minutes 15-20?" vs. "Tell me about budget"
- **Provide context**: "In the context of Q2 planning, what were the main risks discussed?"
- **Use examples**: "Find statements similar to 'we need to accelerate the timeline'"

**Response Quality Improvement:**
- **Ask for citations**: "Please include specific quotes and timestamps"
- **Request structure**: "Organize your response as a numbered list"
- **Seek clarification**: "Can you explain what you mean by 'resource constraints'?"

**✅ Checkpoint:** You can effectively use AI chat to explore and analyze your transcripts with natural conversation.

## Part 3: Advanced Search and Discovery

### Step 4: Semantic Search Mastery

**Beyond Keyword Search:**
Semantic search understands meaning, not just words:

**Traditional Search Limitations:**
- Must use exact words that appear in transcripts
- Can't find related concepts expressed differently
- Misses context and implied meanings

**Semantic Search Capabilities:**
- Finds content by meaning and concept
- Understands synonyms and related terms
- Considers context and intent
- Discovers implicit connections

### Advanced Search Techniques

**Concept-Based Discovery:**
```
Instead of: "budget meeting"
Try: "financial planning discussion"
Find: Conversations about budgets, expenses, financial strategy, cost management

Instead of: "project delay"
Try: "timeline challenges"
Find: Discussions about delays, scheduling issues, resource constraints, missed deadlines
```

**Natural Language Queries:**
```
"What are the team's biggest concerns about the product launch?"
"Find all discussions about customer feedback and complaints"
"Show me conversations where people disagreed about the timeline"
"What did the engineering team say about technical feasibility?"
```

**Cross-Transcript Pattern Discovery:**
```
"Find similar discussions across all project meetings"
"What themes appear in both technical and marketing conversations?"
"Show me how the team's confidence changed over time"
"What topics generated the most debate or discussion?"
```

### Search Workflow Integration

**Search-to-Chat Pipeline:**
1. **Use search** to find relevant content: "Find discussions about customer requirements"
2. **Start chat** with search results as context
3. **Explore findings**: "Analyze these customer requirement discussions for common themes"
4. **Deep dive**: "What specific features did customers request most often?"

**Search-to-Analysis Workflow:**
1. **Search for pattern**: Find all mentions of specific topics across projects
2. **Aggregate results**: Collect related content from multiple sources
3. **Generate analysis**: Use AI to analyze patterns across the search results
4. **Export insights**: Create reports based on search-driven discoveries

**Search Optimization:**
- **Use filters effectively**: Date ranges, speakers, projects for focused discovery
- **Combine search types**: Start semantic, refine with keyword search
- **Save useful searches**: Create search templates for recurring analysis needs
- **Track search patterns**: Learn what works for your content and use cases

**✅ Checkpoint:** You can effectively use semantic search to discover content and patterns that keyword search would miss.

## Part 4: Custom Analysis and Automation

### Step 5: Advanced Analysis Customization

**Custom Analysis Prompts:**
Create specialized analysis templates for your specific needs:

**Industry-Specific Analysis:**
```

"Analyze this software development team conversation focusing on:
1. Technical decisions made and their rationale
2. Identified blockers and proposed solutions  
3. Quality concerns and testing strategies
4. Team coordination and communication patterns
5. Sprint progress and velocity indicators"
```

**Role-Based Analysis Templates:**
```
