## File Preparation Best Practices

### Audio Quality Optimization

**For Best Results:**
- **Clear audio**: Minimize background noise
- **Good volume**: Not too quiet or too loud
- **Consistent levels**: Avoid major volume changes
- **Single language**: One language per file works best

**Audio Settings:**
- **Sample rate**: 16kHz minimum, 44.1kHz recommended
- **Bit depth**: 16-bit minimum, 24-bit for high quality
- **Compression**: Moderate compression is fine (128kbps+ for MP3)

### File Organization Before Upload

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use descriptive, consistent file names
- Include dates if relevant (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Avoid special characters (&, %, #, etc.)
- Keep names under 100 characters

**Folder Structure:**
- Organize files by project or topic
- Group related recordings together
- Consider chronological organization
- Separate different speakers/sources

## Upload Configuration

### Basic Information

**Title Field:**
- **Auto-generated**: Based on filename if left empty
- **Custom titles**: More descriptive and searchable
- **Best practice**: Include topic, date, and context

**Description Field:**
- **Optional**: But highly recommended for searchability
- **Content suggestions**: Meeting topic, participants, purpose
- **Searchable**: Text appears in search results

### Advanced Options

**Processing Priority:**
- **High**: Process immediately (for urgent content)
- **Normal**: Standard queue processing (default)
- **Low**: Process when system is less busy

**Quality Settings:**
- **Best Quality**: Slower processing, best results
- **Balanced**: Good quality, reasonable speed (default)
- **Fast**: Quick processing, adequate quality

**Project Assignment:**
- **Select project**: Assign to existing project
- **Create new**: Start new project with this file
- **No project**: Keep in general library

## Batch Upload Management

### Selecting Multiple Files

**File Browser Selection:**
- Hold `Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd` (Mac) while clicking
- Hold `Shift` to select ranges
- Use `Ctrl+A`/`Cmd+A` to select all

**Drag and Drop Multiple:**
- Select multiple files in file manager
- Drag the selection into DeepTalk
- All files upload with shared settings

### Batch Configuration

**Apply to All:**
- Set project assignment for entire batch
- Configure processing priority for all files
- Set quality level for complete batch

**Individual Customization:**
- Modify titles and descriptions per file
- Adjust settings for specific files
- Remove files from batch before processing

## Processing and Progress Monitoring

### Understanding the Upload Process

**Stage 1: File Upload**
- Files copied to DeepTalk's storage
- Quick validation of file format
- Progress bar shows upload completion

**Stage 2: Audio Extraction**
- Audio extracted from video files
- Audio conversion for optimization
- Preparation for transcription service

**Stage 3: Transcription Queue**
- Files queued for transcription
- Processing order based on priority and size
- Progress visible on Home page and Library

### Monitoring Progress

**Progress Indicators:**
- **Upload progress**: File transfer percentage
- **Queue position**: Where your file is in line
- **Processing status**: Current processing stage
- **Estimated time**: Approximate completion time

**Where to Check Status:**
- **Home page**: Overview of all processing
- **Library page**: Individual file status
- **Processing queue**: Detailed queue view
- **Notifications**: Status updates and completion alerts

## Large File Handling

### Files Over 1GB

**Preparation:**
- Ensure stable internet connection (if using remote services)
- Close other applications to free memory
- Consider splitting very long recordings

**Processing Considerations:**
- Longer processing times expected
- May be chunked automatically for better handling
- Monitor system resources during processing

### Long Duration Files (Over 2 Hours)

**Automatic Chunking:**
- DeepTalk automatically splits long files
- Chunks processed separately then combined
- Prevents memory issues and improves accuracy

**Chunk Settings:**
- Default chunk size: 5 minutes
- Configurable in Settings > Processing
- Overlap between chunks for continuity

## Troubleshooting Upload Issues

### Common Upload Problems

**File Won't Upload:**
- **Check format**: Ensure file is supported
- **Check size**: Verify file isn't too large
- **Check permissions**: Ensure file isn't locked/in use
- **Try different location**: Some network drives cause issues

**Upload Fails Partway:**
- **Network issues**: Check internet connection
- **Disk space**: Ensure enough free space available
- **File corruption**: Try uploading different file
- **Restart**: Close and reopen DeepTalk

**Processing Stalls:**
- **Service issues**: Check service status in Settings
- **System resources**: Close other applications
- **File complexity**: Some formats take longer
- **Restart processing**: Cancel and retry if needed

### File Quality Issues

**Poor Transcription Quality:**
- **Audio clarity**: Use higher quality source files
- **Background noise**: Minimize environmental sounds
- **Multiple speakers**: Consider speaker separation
- **Service configuration**: Check transcription service settings

**Processing Errors:**
- **Unsupported format**: Convert file to supported format
- **Corrupted file**: Try re-recording or different source
- **Size limits**: Split large files before upload
- **System requirements**: Verify system meets minimum specs

## Tips for Efficient Uploading

### Workflow Optimization

**Batch Similar Content:**
- Upload related files together
- Use consistent naming and organization
- Process similar content types in batches

**Prepare Files in Advance:**
- Organize files before uploading
- Prepare titles and descriptions beforehand
- Check audio quality before processing

**Use Off-Peak Hours:**
- Upload large files during low-usage times
- Take advantage of faster processing
- Avoid conflicts with other system activities

### Quality vs. Speed Trade-offs

**For Quick Results:**
- Use "Fast" processing mode
- Upload smaller files first
- Use compressed audio formats

**For Best Quality:**
- Use "Best Quality" processing mode
- Upload high-quality source files
- Allow extra time for processing

**For Balanced Approach:**
- Use default "Balanced" settings
- Moderate file sizes (under 500MB)
- Standard audio quality (44.1kHz, 16-bit)
