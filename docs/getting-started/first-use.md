# First Use Guide

Congratulations on installing DeepTalk! This guide will walk you through your first launch and initial setup.

## First Launch

When you launch DeepTalk for the first time, here's what to expect:

### 1. Welcome Screen
- DeepTalk will open to the **Home** page
- You'll see a clean interface with navigation tabs at the top
- The interface includes: Home, Projects, Library, Settings, and About

### 2. Initial Interface Overview

**Navigation Tabs:**
- üè† **Home**: Your dashboard and recent activity
- üìÅ **Projects**: Organize transcripts into projects  
- üìã **Library**: Manage individual transcripts
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Settings**: Configure DeepTalk preferences
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **About**: Application information

### 3. Service Status Check
On the Home page, you'll see a **Service Status** indicator:
- üü° **Yellow**: Services connecting (normal on first launch)
- üî¥ **Red**: Service connection errors (expected without external services)
- üü¢ **Green**: All services connected

**Don't worry**: DeepTalk works great even without external services!

## Basic Configuration (Optional)

### Quick Settings Check

Let's do a quick settings review to ensure everything is configured correctly:

1. **Click** the ‚öôÔ∏è **Settings** tab
2. **Review** the main sections:

#### Transcription Settings
- **Service URL**: Default is `http://localhost:8000` (for future Speaches setup)
- **Model**: Default speech-to-text model (fine for basic use)
- **Audio Chunk Size**: Default 60 seconds (good for most files)

#### Processing Settings  
- **AI Analysis URL**: Default is `http://localhost:11434` (for future Ollama setup)
- **Transcript Correction**: Enabled by default (improves accuracy)
- **Speaker Tagging**: Disabled by default (can enable later)

#### General Settings
- **Auto-backup**: Enabled by default (recommended)
- **Theme**: System default (matches your OS theme)

**Recommendation**: Keep the default settings for now. You can always adjust them later as you learn more about DeepTalk.

## Understanding DeepTalk's Approach

### Privacy-First Design
- **All data stays on your computer** - nothing is sent to external servers unless you configure specific services
- **Local storage** - your transcripts and analysis are stored in a local database
- **Optional services** - external transcription and AI services are entirely optional

### How It Works
1. **Upload** audio or video files
2. **Transcribe** using built-in capabilities or external services
3. **Analyze** content for insights (basic analysis works offline)
4. **Organize** transcripts into projects for better management
5. **Chat** with your transcripts using AI (requires Ollama setup)

## Your First Transcript (Basic Mode)

Let's create your first transcript to get familiar with the interface:

### Method 1: From Home Page
1. **Stay** on the Home page
2. **Look** for upload options or quick actions
3. **Click** upload or "Add New" button

### Method 2: From Library
1. **Click** the üìã **Library** tab
2. **Look** for an "Upload" or "Add Transcript" button
3. **Click** to start the upload process

### What to Expect
1. **File Selection**: Choose an audio or video file from your computer
2. **Processing**: DeepTalk will process the file (may take a few minutes)
3. **Basic Transcription**: Even without external services, you'll get basic processing
4. **Results**: View your transcript in the Library
