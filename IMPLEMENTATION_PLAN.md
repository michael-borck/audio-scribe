## Phase 1: Core Navigation & Dashboard Improvements

### 1.1 Sidebar Menu Restructure
**Current State:** Navigation is limited and doesn't support frequent actions
**Proposed Change:** Global sidebar with enhanced navigation

**Implementation:**
```
Sidebar Menu:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìä Dashboard (recent activity focused)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üì§ Upload & Process (global access)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîç Search & Filter (new!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìö Library (all transcripts)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ Projects (all projects)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üóëÔ∏è Trash (new!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üì¶ Archive (new!)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚öôÔ∏è Settings
```

**Benefits:**
- Quick Upload accessible from any page
- Central search/filter functionality
- Clear data management with Trash/Archive

### 1.2 Dashboard Redesign
**Current State:** Project-focused view that becomes less useful with many transcripts
**Proposed Change:** Activity-focused dashboard

**Implementation:**
- 5 Most Recent Transcripts (sorted by last accessed/created)
- 3 Most Active Projects (sorted by last used, not created)
- Keep all existing stats and information
- Remove processing queue (move to Upload modal)

**Rationale:** Users need quick access to recent work, both transcripts and projects

---

## Phase 2: Upload & Processing Enhancements

### 2.1 Global Upload & Process Modal
**Current Name:** Quick Upload
**Proposed Names:** "Upload & Process" / "Add Media" / "New Recording"

**Features:**
- File selection area
- Processing queue (moved from dashboard)
- Project assignment dropdown:
  - None (default)
  - Existing projects (sorted by most recent)
  - "+ New Project" option
- Processing settings (STT model, validation options)
- Upload button

**New Project Flow:**
- Selecting "+ New Project" opens existing new project modal
- Request name and description
- Return to upload modal with new project selected

### 2.2 Multi-Project Support
**Change:** Transcripts can belong to multiple projects

**Database Impact:**
- Many-to-many relationship between transcripts and projects
- Project badges on transcript cards
- "Also in:" section on transcript detail page

**Benefits:**
- Same interview can be in "Leadership Study" AND "Q4 Review"
- Supports cross-project analysis
- More flexible organization

### 2.3 Duplicate File Handling
**Implementation:**
- Warning dialog: "This file is already in [Project A, Project B]. Continue?"
- Allow duplicate uploads (different analysis runs may yield different insights)
- Let researchers manage duplicates based on their needs

---

## Phase 3: Search, Filter & Organization

### 3.1 Universal Search & Filter Page
**New Feature:** Dedicated search/filter interface

**Features:**
- Full-text search across all transcripts and projects
- Filter options:
  - Keywords/themes
  - Speakers
  - Date ranges
  - Sentiment
  - Duration
  - Project association
- Mixed results showing both projects and transcripts
- Bulk actions toolbar

**Actions from Results:**
- View item
- Add transcript(s) to project(s)
- Create new project from selected transcripts
- Bulk tagging
- Move to archive/trash

### 3.2 Smart Project Assignment
**Feature:** Reuse search/filter for "Add Existing" in projects

**Implementation:**
- When in a project, "Add Existing" opens search/filter interface
- Pre-filtered to exclude transcripts already in project
- "Add to Project" button instead of "View"
- Smart suggestions (configurable in settings)

**Smart Suggestions:**
- Optional setting: "Enable project suggestions for new transcripts"
- Shows: "Suggested projects: Project A (85% match)"
- Can be dismissed
- Prevents annoyance for separate studies

---

## Phase 4: Data Management & Archival

### 4.1 Enhanced Deletion Flow
**Current:** Simple delete
**Proposed:** Granular removal options

**Delete Modal Design:**
```
Transcript: "Customer Interview - Jan 2024"

This transcript is part of these projects:
‚òë Project A: Customer Interviews
‚òë Project B: Q4 Analysis  
‚òê Project C: Product Research
‚òë Project D: Executive Summary

What would you like to do?

[Remove from Selected Projects] [Remove from All Projects] 
[Move to Trash] [Cancel]
```

**Options:**
1. **Remove from Selected Projects** - Removes only from checked projects
2. **Remove from All Projects** - Keeps transcript but removes all associations
3. **Move to Trash** - Moves to trash (can be restored within 30 days)

**Pre-selection Logic:**
- From Library view ‚Üí All projects pre-checked
- From Project view ‚Üí Only current project pre-checked

### 4.2 Trash System
**Implementation:**
- 30-day retention period
- Combined list of projects and transcripts (no tabs needed)
- Actions:
  - Restore individual items
  - Empty trash (with confirmation)
  - Auto-cleanup after 30 days

**Restore Logic:**
- Restoring a project also restores related transcripts if in trash
- If transcript missing, restore project but notify user

### 4.3 Archive System
**Location:** Sidebar menu item
**Implementation:**
- Two tabs: "Archived Projects" | "Archived Transcripts"
- Move to archive for long-term storage
- Archived items don't appear in main lists
- Can restore from archive anytime

**Use Cases:**
- Completed research projects
- Old transcripts for reference
- Declutter active workspace
